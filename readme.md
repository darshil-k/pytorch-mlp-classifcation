# Multi-Layer Perceptron model for multi-class classification

This is a multi-layer perceptron model for multi-class classification using the pytorch library.

## Dataset
MNIST: Handwritten digits dataset

## Logging and Monitoring
We use Tensorboard for logging and monitoring the model training process.

## TODO
- Add support for custom datasets
- Add logging dataset summary
- Create a separate class for accuracy metrics
- Loss function and Optimizer should be configurable and added to logs
- Add test, inference & batch inference scripts
